## ðŸš€ Summary

Hey there! I'm Pratyush, a senior at Cornell studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I build systems that make sense of complexity â€” from scalable backend architectures to algorithms designed for connection and care.

Over the past four years, my work has spanned software engineering, data infrastructure, and product design. I've led projects in matching systems, machine learning workflows, and developer tooling â€” but what really drives me is the human side of tech: How can software better reflect the way people think, feel, and grow?

I'm especially passionate about technology that supports mental health, cognitive diversity, and meaningful interaction. The best systems, to me, aren't just fast or scalable â€” they're thoughtful, accessible, and built with real people in mind.

Curious about my life beyond coding? You'll find me doing martial arts (Kickboxing, Silat, Kali, Jeet Kune Do, Wushu), breakdancing where I channel my energy and passion, biking around Ithaca on whimsical Wednesdays, or journaling about resilience and growth.

I also write about the intersection of technology and human psychology at <a href="https://blogs.pratyushsudhakar.com/">blogs.pratyushsudhakar.com</a>.

Currently looking for full-time software engineering or product roles starting in 2025 â€” especially with teams building with empathy, creativity, and intention.

<!-- Beyond the professional and social life: Iâ€™m unapologetically Autistic, and Iâ€™ve spent my life engaging in high masking rituals to blend in with neurotypicals. While I want to minimize this masking, navigating a world full of ableism often requires it. Iâ€™m just trying to find a balance and be as authentic as possible. -->
