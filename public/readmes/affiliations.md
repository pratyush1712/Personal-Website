## Vice-President at [Cornell Wushu - Chinese Martial Arts Club](https://cornellwushu.github.io/)

**Duration:** September 2021 - Present


**The club taught me a lot of life lessons**: Mental Illness is very real. Stigma is very real. Stupidity is very real. Fake personalities, personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar disorder, hypomania, hallucinations, autism, empaths, dark empaths, maturity, morality, confidence, identity, corruption, selfishness, egoistic personality, childhood trauma response, people pleasing as a trauma response are all very real issues that people face in the world. Sometimes, it is very white and black, but people's stupidity make it look like a lot of gray. People are very incapable of seeing other people's perspective or feel for anyone but themselves. Setting healthy boundaries with your loved ones, loving them unconditionally and being there for them always, even when they don't realize they need you, is the bare minimum one should do in any kind of non-toxic relationship.
