00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,640
Hey founders, I'm Pratyush, neuro-hacker someone who systematically measures

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,260
and optimizes brain function. Right now,

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm streaming my own EEG data live showing the technical,

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,640
electrical patterns of my brain as I speak.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,060
Over the past one year, I've logged more than 1000 hours of data from

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,140
EEG headsets, heart rate,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,960
variability, sensors, whoop wearable,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,220
mood and focus applications like Animi and sleep trackers and

9
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:33,860
journaling, I've tested 50 plus nootropics,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,000
dozens of meditation techniques, acupuncture sessions,

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,520
and talktherapy. My conclusion,

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,020
all these tools work, but facing together what actually moves the needle takes

13
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:49,380
hundreds of tedious hours. Time that something most people simply don't have.

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,220
So I'm building some building a platform that works as both

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,560
a universal tracker and an experimentation engine.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,020
So in this engine, first the user integrates everything their variable data,

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,740
their self-reported surveys and mood logs,

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,800
habit tracking and journal entries, once all that data is collected,

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,080
the AI model identifies the user's limitations.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,440
For example, one cannot focus for more than 30 hours,

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,320
30 minutes. And as the AI identifies

22
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:27,840
the limitations for the users, they also build and design

23
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,040
these personalized protocol suggestions,

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,700
which is based on the user's data,

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,420
the neuroscience research, as well as community tested routines.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,800
Once the user has this protocol,

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,040
they can test the protocol track-the-outcome and share the results back with the community.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,160
And I was inspired by Elizabeth Ricker's Smarter tomorrow

29
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:55,780
which shows that just 15 minutes of targeted brain training-per-day body

30
00:01:55,781 --> 00:02:00,600
can transform performance. My platform automates the four steps

31
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,840
that are highlighted in the book, tracking,

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,300
identifying, experimenting, and measuring.

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,620
So any user does not have to spend one piecing it all together and

34
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:16,360
who benefits from this platform. engineers who're trying to extend their deep focus

35
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,360
sessions, founders managing real-time fundraising stress,

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,820
artists breaking through creative jobs, and people struggling with

37
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:28,360
mental illness trying to get out of their struggles,

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,040
all through personalized data-driven neuro-hacking,

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,880
amplified by a global community of contributors,

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,940
sharing what works for them. At off season I want to democratize

41
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:45,620
brain optimization, making peak cognitive performance accessible to

42
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,160
everyone with down to $1,000 hours worth.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,820
That's just me, the neuro-hacker.
